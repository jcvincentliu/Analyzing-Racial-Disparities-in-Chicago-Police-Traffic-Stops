## Project Deliverable

Participants will produce a report and set of Jupyter notebooks documenting a regression-adjusted benchmark test on traffic stops in Chicago. The analysis should test for evidence of discrimination in stop rates while controlling for factors like crime, location, and traffic hazards (as data allows). The project will also include a limited analysis on whether traffic stops impact crime. Students will perform the analysis and will work with BPI mentors to draft descriptions of the methodology and analysis that are accessible and understandable to a wider audience.
