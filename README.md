# Analyzing Police Traffic Stops in Chicago

## Project Information and Objectives

The repository contains a series of works done for BPI (Business and Professional People for Public Interest), a non-profit organization, in the Data Classic Clinc class, a practicum course organized and hosted by DSI (Data Science Institute) at the University of Chicago. As an ongoing collaborative with BPI, the poject has two objectives: analyzing racial disparaties in Chicago traffic stops and investigating potential associations between the use of traffic stop practice and the crime rates of an area. The two goals are achieved through conducting explorative analysis, benchmark analysis, and poisson logistic regressions. Wholistically, the project tries to see if Chicago Police Officers stopped drivers differently based on their race and if such differences were driven by extrinstic reasons, such as high crime activies or intrinstic reasons, such as officers' own biases. Some parts of the work replicated established literature, for example, [*Wood et al., 2018*](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/An-Analysis-of-the-Metropolitan-Nashville-Police-%E2%80%99-Chohlas-Wood-Goel/ea1e629021ab3e4f6b548b7d11f9ae12b07df83e).
